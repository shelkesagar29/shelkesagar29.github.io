My name is Sagar. Iâ€™m a Deep Learning Software Developer at NVIDIA, where I mainly work on the [MLIR-TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Incubator/tree/main/mlir-tensorrt) project. I also collaborate with NVIDIA automotive customers to help them optimize their workloads for maximum performance on NVIDIA hardware and software.
